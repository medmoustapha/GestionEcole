<sect1>Using <tt/include()/ instead of <tt/auto&lowbar;prepend&lowbar;file=/
<p>If you do not want to use <tt/auto&lowbar;prepend&lowbar;file/ to load the
PHPLIB core functionality, you can load the class definitions
for the core manually on each page that requires them.

You will have to define a valid
<tt/include&lowbar;path=/-statement in your <tt/php3.ini/ file
as outlined previously to reflect the location of the <tt/*.inc/
files. Then, all core functionality can be loaded with
<tt/include("prepend.php3")/ as the first statement at the top
of each page.

To further optimize performance, you can minimize the contents
of the prepend file, if you do not need all core functionality.
You <em/may/ leave out <tt/auth.inc/, <tt/perm.inc/ and
<tt/user.inc/, if you do not require these features (note that
there are dependencies among these classes!).
