The initial idea on how to do serialization was contributed by
<htmlurl url="mailto:khwild@wicom.at" name="KH Wild"> to the
php3 mailing list. It was limited to serializing arrays of at
most three dimensions, though. We worked on his solution,
improving it to arrays of arbitrary depth and later rewrote the
function from scratch, turning it upside down. Our new
serialization code can now handle any first order data type
available to PHP and is easily extensible. It is also
encapsulated in a class, keeping the name space clean. While we
were at it, we made session cookies more secure
by not using uniquid() directly, but a md5() hash of uniqid().

McMullan contributed some nice ideas for cleanup and is working
