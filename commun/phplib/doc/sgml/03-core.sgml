<sect>Core Functionality
<p>
Each class contains instance variables and instance methods. Some of these
variables and methods are available for customization, some are internal to
the classes themselves. All are documented, but tampering with internal
variables and methods is not supported. Internal interfaces are subject to
change without notice from one version of the library to another.

<p>
This section covers PHPLIB core functionality in reference form.
Classes are presented in order of dependency, though, because
the core structure is easier understood in this order. You will
need to understand the complete core structure to successfully
use all of PHPLIB's features.
