<sect1>Quick Guide to Installation
<p>

These instructions apply to PHPLIB running with CGI PHP. Most of
them are valid for mod&lowbar;php as well, though. <em>VERY
IMPORTANT NOTE:</em> This is a quick installation guide to get
you started if you have an installation where you control the
web server, PHP interpreter and database server completely. They
are not suitable for a web hosting setup where you have only
limited to no control over the installation. Refer to Chapter 2
of this documentation for the complete installation instructions
and troubleshooting information.

Before installing PHPLIB, get your web server up and running and
have it executing files with the extension .php3. Check that
with a simple <tt/&lt;?php phpinfo() ?&gt;/ script. Make sure
the web server accepts <tt/index.php3/ as well as <tt/index.html/
as a default file for URLs ending in "/" (Apache:
<tt/DirectoryIndex index.html index.php3/).

Get your MySQL database server up an running. Create an empty
database for your application and make sure the owner of your
web server processes can access this database with <tt/SELECT/,
<tt/INSERT/, <tt/UPDATE/ and <tt/DELETE/ access. Don't forget
the <tt/mysqladmin reload/ after changing the user and db tables.

<descrip>
<tag>Step 1</tag>
<p>Create an include directory named <tt/php/ parallel to your
   web servers document root directory. Do not put the include
   directory below your web servers document root.

<tag>Step 2</tag>
<p>Unpack your PHPLIB distribution. Move the contents of the
   <tt/php/ distribution directory into the <tt/php/ directory
   you just created.

<tag>Step 3</tag>
<p>Get to the <tt/php3.ini/ file for your web servers PHP
   interpreter and update the <tt/include&lowbar;path/ statement so
   that it points to that <tt/php/ directory. Update the
   <tt/auto&lowbar;prepend&lowbar;file/ statement so that it points to the
   <tt/prepend.php3/ file in that include directory.

   If you do not have control over your php3.ini file, you did not
   read the <em>VERY IMPORTANT NOTE</em> above.

<tag>Step 4</tag>
<p>Also check that <tt/track&lowbar;vars/ are enabled and that you have
   enabled <tt/magic&lowbar;quotes&lowbar;gpc/. While you are at it, you might
   want to check <tt/sendmail&lowbar;path/, if you plan to send mail from
   your application. It has to be set to <tt>/usr/lib/sendmail -t</tt>
   on most UNIX systems to work.

   If you do not have control over your php3.ini file, you did
   not read the <em>VERY IMPORTANT NOTE</em> above.

<tag>Step 5</tag>
<p>cd into the <tt/php/ include directory. Edit <tt/local.inc/.
   In <tt/class DB&lowbar;Example/ supply the appropriate parameters for
   your database connection.

<tag>Step 6</tag>
<p>For this database, run <tt/create&lowbar;database.mysql/ from the
   distribution to create <tt/active&lowbar;sessions/ and
   <tt/auth&lowbar;user/.  <tt/auth&lowbar;user/ will be populated with a
   sample user named <tt/kris/ with a password <tt/test/.

<tag>Step 7</tag>
<p>Move the contents of the <tt/pages/ directory and all its
   subdirectories into your document root directory.

<tag>Step 8</tag>
<p>Access the "/" URL of your web server with cookies enabled. If
   no <tt/index.html/ is present, <tt/index.php3/ will be displayed.
   If you reload that page, the number shown must increment.
   Access your database with the mysql command client and <tt/select
   * from active&lowbar;sessions/. Check that there is a single session
   record for your browser and see how the text in <tt/val/
   changes when you reload the page and <tt/select * from
   active&lowbar;sessions/ again. If this works, the session class is
   functional with cookie mode.

<tag>Step 9</tag>
<p>Now access <tt/showoff.php3/. Try to login as <tt/kris/,
   password <tt/test/. Check <tt/active&lowbar;sessions/ again. You now
   should have a <tt/Example&lowbar;Session/ entry (see the <tt/name/
   column) and a <tt/Example&lowbar;User/ entry in your table. Both should
   increment on reload.

<tag>Step 10</tag>
<p>Try again with cookies disabled. You should get a new session
   (the cookie is lost) and you should be able to see your
   session id as the get parameter part of your URL.
