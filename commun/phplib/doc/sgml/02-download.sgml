<sect1>Downloading and unpacking the distribution

<p>The base library is available from <htmlurl
url="http://phplib.sourceforge.net/" name="the PHP Base Library
download location">. Two different formats are provided: A
tar.gz version and a shar version.

If you are on a windows system, you can use phplib.tar.gz, if
you have WinZIP installed. Current versions of WinZIP know how
to handle compressed tar archives. The uncompressed files may be
installed on your windows system or transferred to your Unix
system.

If you can't handle binary files, you may download phplib.shar.
This is a pure ASCII file containing a self extracting shell
script. Just save the file, make it executable and feed it to
your Unix shell (for example, by typing <tt/sh phplib.shar/).

The <htmlurl url="mailto:phplib-users@lists.sourceforge.net" name="PHPLIB
support mailing list"> is available should you run into problems
with the library. To subscribe to the list, send a message with
<tt/subscribe/ as the subject to the address
<tt/phplib-users-request@lists.sourceforge.net/.
