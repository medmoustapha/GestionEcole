To build the HTML/TXT files from the source, you need the older
distribution of sgml-tools available from

	http://www.sgmltools.org/

The never versions (2.x) cannot be used. After you have installed
them correctly, a single

	make

is enough to build the complete documentation.

If you want to add a class documentation to PHPLIB, use template.sgml
in this directory.
