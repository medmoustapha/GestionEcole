<P>The initial idea on how to do serialization was contributed by
<A HREF="mailto:khwild@wicom.at">KH Wild</A> to the
php3 mailing list. It was limited to serializing arrays of at
most three dimensions, though. We worked on his solution,
improving it to arrays of arbitrary depth and later rewrote the
function from scratch, turning it upside down. Our new
serialization code can now handle any first order data type
available to PHP and is easily extensible. It is also
encapsulated in a class, keeping the name space clean. While we
were at it, we made session cookies more secure
by not using uniquid() directly, but a md5() hash of uniqid().</P>
<P>Cameron Taggart and Guarneri Carmelo contributed ODBC support.
Szandor van Verseveld contributed PostgreSQL support. Scott
McMullan contributed some nice ideas for cleanup and is working
on Sybase support.</P>
<P>Sascha Schumann contributed much time developing and extending
PHPLIB, including but not limited to mSQL/Sybase support, general
storage container support, shared memory and LDAP support.</P>
<P>Alexander Aulbach submitted his Tree class. Jay Bloodworth
contributed his excellent OOH Forms library for form generation
