Some rules for CVS committers:

- All changes to classes must be matched by changes to
  the SGML documentation source. I will reject all commits
  that do not keep the docs up to date.

- All changes to class behaviour must be logged in the
  CHANGES file, at the top.

- The source is indented using spaces and a indentation
  level of 4. There are no tabs in the source.

- Keep your changes compatible.

- Try to avoid things that slow the lib extremely. We
  are prepended to almost all pages on a site, we need
  to stay small.

- Use meaningful log messages. They are collected and mailed
  out to the mailing list, phplib-dev@lists.netuse.de.
